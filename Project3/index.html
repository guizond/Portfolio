                    <h3>A little about my life.</h3>
                    <p>So my story begun in 22 of august 1999, in a very small city called Novo Horizonte do Norte, in the state of Mato Grosso, but my mom is from Santa Catarina, when she was around her 20's she went to MT to study and when I was 8 years old, she decided to move back to Santa Catarina, to be closer with her family, so my mom, my brother and I moved from a small city in MT to an even smaller city in SC, that is called Dona Emma. Fast forwarding to when I was 17 and moved out from my moms house to live with my brother in a relatively bigger city. In this new city I got my first job in a supermarket, and I was thinking, “I just finish school, what now?”, at that point I really was pretty much lost in what to do with my future, I even started to study Modern Languages, not because I like it, it was more family pression actually. So when I was 19 years old, I decided to move to Blumenau. I get a job and after a few months dividing the apartment with a friend that was working as a developer I begun to consider it as an option, and after researching more about the work itself something clicked in my mind and I realized that I really like the job, and I like everything around it. I started to study more about it. I did some courses. I always try to make something to never forget what I have learnt so far. Unfortunately, I never got a job in the area that I study because I haven't had the necessary tech skills, until now! I had an idea of make a few projects, upload to my GitHub and send out to some companies that I follow and admire, to show that I do have a few skills, and yes, they may not be the most advanced ones, but I am just starting, and I know that I am capable of doing amazing things, I really just need an opportunity to grow and show my value. So, if you read until here, first thing first, thank you so much, and I hope we can work together someday.</p>
